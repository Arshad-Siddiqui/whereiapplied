# Where I Applied

This is a web app to keep track of the places I have applied.

## New things I'm trying

- MUI (Material UI)
- Mobile first design

## What it looks like as of 23/06/2023

![Image of the app](./pics/app_img.png)

> Greyed out cards are archived.

## To the future

- [] Let people sign in and save their own applications.
- [] Add more filtering options.
- [] Let people click a card and get a more detailed view of the application.

## Problems

- Entire body has a margin-top which is problematic for when there is no navbar
